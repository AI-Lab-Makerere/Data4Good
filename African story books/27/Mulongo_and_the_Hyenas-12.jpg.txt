The big hyena sat in the
doorway of the hut and
the others went off in
different directions. They
took a long time, and the
big hyena began to doze
in front of the warm fire.
Soon he was snoring. This
was Mulongo's chance!
But how was she going to
get past the hyena? He
was so big he filled the
whole doorway.
