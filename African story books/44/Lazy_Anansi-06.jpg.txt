As Anansi walked by Warthog's house, he
smelled sweet potatoes. Warthog told
Anansi, "My pot is full of sweet potatoes and
honey! Come and share my food with me.
Take this fork and help me to stir it." Anansi
replied, "I'll come back later. Let me tie one
end of this web around my leg and one end
to your pot. When the sweet potatoes are
ready, pull on the web string, and I'll come."
