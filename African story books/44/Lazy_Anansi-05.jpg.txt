Anansi saw Monkey and his wife, cooking
beans in a large pot. "Come and join us! The
beans are nearly ready." Monkey said. Anansi
replied, "Sorry, I have things to do. Let me tie
one end of this web around my leg and one
end to your pot. When the beans are ready,
pull on the web string, and I'll come."
