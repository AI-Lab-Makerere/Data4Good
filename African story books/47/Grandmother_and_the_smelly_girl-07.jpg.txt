The smelly Tasneem ran home to her
parents. She sang, "Mother, open the
door for me, Iam smelly. Mother, open
the door for me, Iam smelly. Mother,
open the door for me, the smell is very
bad."

Her mother heard Tasneem and ran
out of the house. She sang back to the
girl, "Go away, you are smelly. Go
away, you are smelly. Go away, the
smell is very bad."
