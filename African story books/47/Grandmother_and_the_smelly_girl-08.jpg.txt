Tasneem was very upset. She ran off
to the house of her aunt and uncle.
She sang, "Open the door for me, lam
smelly. Open the door for me, Iam
smelly. Open the door for me, the
smell is very bad."

They heard Tasneem and ran out of
the house. They sang back to the girl,
"Go away, you are smelly. Go away,
you are smelly. Go away, the smell is
very bad."
