They finished swimming. The leader of
the jealous girls threw Tasneem's
makgabe into the river, near the place
of a very large snake. Then the other
girls left Tasneem crying by the river.

The very large snake heard someone
weeping. He saw the beautiful
Tasneem. He swallowed the makgabe
and Tasneem!
