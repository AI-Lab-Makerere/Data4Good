A long time ago, there was a man who
lived with his wife whom he loved very
much. One day he took a walk to the
forest. Along the way, he met a tall,
slender, and very beautiful girl. He fell
in love with her at first sight. The girl
too readily accepted him. But she told
him that she had only one breast.
