Furious, Anansi went and reported the
theft to the chief. But Vulture said to
the chief and his elders, "How could
anyone leave a basket full of money
and maize unguarded on the road?"
"But I was watching my basket," said
Anansi. "It's my money and my maize!"
"I was looking after the basket when
you came and said it was yours!"
replied Vulture.
