Anansi saw Vulture sitting on his
basket. "Oh thank you, my friend, for
protecting my basket," he said to the
Vulture. "Excuse me, Anansi, did I hear
you right?" asked Vulture. "Your
basket? This basket is mine! I found it
here on the road side!" Anansi could
not believe his ears! "It's mine, I tell
you!"
