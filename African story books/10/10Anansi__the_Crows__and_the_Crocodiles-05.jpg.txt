The crows felt sorry for him. The next
morning at first light, each crow gave
him a feather. He flew with them to
the fig tree in the middle of the wide
river. When he saw the luscious figs,
Anansi wanted them all for himself.
Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he
shouted out, "That one is mine! I saw it
first!" And then he took the fig and put
it into his bag. Eventually he had all
the figs and the crows had none.
