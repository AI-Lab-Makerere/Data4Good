He thought of a plan. He carefully
covered his bottom with sticky
beeswax. Then he took a piece of clay
pot and went to see the crows. "Please
could you help me?" he asked. "I need
a live coal to get my fire going again."
As they were getting the coal from the
fire, Anansi carefully sat firmly on one
of the largest figs, so that it would stick
to his bottom. He thanked the crows,
and hurried home to enjoy the fig.
