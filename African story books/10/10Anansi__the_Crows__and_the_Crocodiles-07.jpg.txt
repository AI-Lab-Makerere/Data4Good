"What do we have here?" said a gruff
crocodile voice. "A tasty morsel to eat,
nyum" "Oh please don't," said Anansi.
And he began to cry. "I'm one of you,
don't you know? I got lost in the days
of your grandfathers and no one was
able to find me. You're the first of my
relatives I've ever met!" He cried so
much that the crocodiles felt sorry for
him.
