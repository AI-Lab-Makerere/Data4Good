The oldest crocodile said, "We'll know
you're one of us if you can eat and
enjoy mud soup just like we do." They
gave him a pot of dirty brown water.
"Just like my grandmother used to
make it!" Anansi said. But he made a
hole in the ground with his back foot,
and a hole in the pot with his front
foot. As he pretended to drink the
soup, it oozed down through the pot
into the hole beneath his feet.
