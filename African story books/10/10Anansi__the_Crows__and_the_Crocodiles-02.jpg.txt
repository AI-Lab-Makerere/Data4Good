One day there was a great famine in
the land. No one had anything to eat
except the crows. Each morning they
flew a long distance to where there
was d tree with ripe figs in the middle
of a wide river. Then they flew back
with the figs for themselves and their
relatives. The sight of so many figs
made Anansi's mouth water. How
could he get them for himself?
