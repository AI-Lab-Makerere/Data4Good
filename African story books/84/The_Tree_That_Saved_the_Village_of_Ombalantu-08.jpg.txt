When Thaimi and her brother reached
the village she called out to everyone,
"Run, run. Men are coming to steal our
cattle and burn our village!" The
villagers were scared but they did not
know where to hide or what to do.
Where could they hide their cattle?
Where could they hide their grain?
Where could they hide themselves?
