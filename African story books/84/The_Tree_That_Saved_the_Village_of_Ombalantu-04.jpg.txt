As she came closer Angula held his
finger to his lips. Close by a group of
strange men were resting. The men
had bows and arrows. And spears!
"Angula," Thaimi whispered. "Those
men are raiders. They have come to
steal our cattle and burn our village.
Come quickly. We must run home and
warn the village." So very quietly and
quickly Thaimi and Angula ran
towards their village.
