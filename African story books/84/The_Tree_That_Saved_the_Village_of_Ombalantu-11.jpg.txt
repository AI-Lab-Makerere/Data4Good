Thaimi and Angula led the way to a
baobab tree which stood nearby. "Why
have you brought us here? We cannot
hide here," they said. Thaimi said to
her father, "Come. I'll show you." They
climbed into a small opening at the
top of the tree. Thaimi and her father
slid down into the big trunk. It was
huge and hollow.
