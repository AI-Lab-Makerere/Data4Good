On her journey, Nonkungu came to a stream.
She crossed the stream and met a girl
wearing rags. The girl asked, "Where are you
going?" Nonkungu replied, "I'm going to visit
my Uncle Mtonyama."

"Well, Mtonyama is my uncle, too! Iam also
on my way to visit him," said the girl. They set
off together. After a while, the girl said to
Nonkungu, "Your clothes are lovely. Please let
me try them on."
