At last they reached the field. Again
Nonkungu asked the imbulu, "Please give me
back my clothes and my beads."

The imbulu replied, "Just let me wear them
until we get to that hut where the women are
sitting." She pointed to a hut in the distance.

But when they finally got near to the hut, the
imbulu pushed Nonkungu back and ran
ahead.
