Once upon a time there was a poor couple
who had only one child, called Nonkungu.
They loved her very much.

When she was old enough, her parents
decided to send Nonkungu to stay with her
rich Uncle Mtonyama.

Nonkungu's mother made special clothes
with ribbon, buttons and beads. Then
Nonkungu set off for her uncle's village.
