Nonkungu told her uncle everything that
had happened. Mtonyama took her back to
the village and hid her in a hut. He knew
what he was going to do to catch the imbulu.

Mtonyama had heard that an imbulu's tail
loves milk and that it can't go past milk
without drinking some. So he told his men to
dig a hole and fill it with sour milk.
