About Biblionef

‘We all want children to become readers - to have empathy for characters, big vocabularies ond
imaginations, ond to be able to immerse themselves in another world through a book Biblionef
places a strong emphasis on reading for pleasure: we believe chikiren should have o sense of fun
@s they read, It should not be a chore, but an exciting activity, something to look forward to,

To achieve this, children need to be exposed to books with great stories. Books which help with
children’s literacy development, give access to information and education, and teach them to think
for themselves - to make good decisions.

Biblionef’s goal is to make a profound impact on the lives of children and we are deeply committed
to giving all children access to books. Biblionef foundations provide new books to library projects for
children who have no access to books. Books containing stories they can relate to and learn from.
