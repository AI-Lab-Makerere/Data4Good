About Biblionef

‘We ail want children to become readers - to have empathy for characters, big vocabularies ond
imaginations, ond to be able to immerse themselves in another world through a book Biblionef
places a strong emphasis on reading for pleasure: we believe children should have o sense of fun
Qs they read. It should not be a chore, but an exciting activity, something to look forward to,

To achieve this, children need to be exposed to books with great stories. Books which help with
children’s literacy development, give access to information and education, and teach them to think
for themselves = to make good decisions.

Biblionef's goo! is to make a profound impact on the lives of children ond we are deeply committed
to giving alll children access to books. Biblionef foundations provide new books to library projects for
children who have no access to books. Books containing stories they can relate to and learn from
