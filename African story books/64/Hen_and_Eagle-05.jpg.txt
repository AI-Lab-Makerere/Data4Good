Eagle was the only one in
the village with a needle,
so she started sewing first.
She made herself a pair of
beautiful wings and flew
high above Hen. Hen
borrowed the needle but
she soon got tired of
sewing. She left the needle
on the cupboard and went
into the kitchen to prepare
food for her children.
