I wondered if children were also sold
at the market. I stopped crying and
looked around to see if anyone would
buy the children in the room. Soon a
woman came in and picked up one of
the children. "I will be the next one to
be taken away," I thought. "And then
I'll never see home again!" I started
crying once more.
