The sun was just rising when we
reached Eldoret market. At the
entrance was a woman selling grains.
Over in one corner there were two
men getting ready to lay out their
sweet potatoes. Over in another
corner was a woman holding a shiny
blue helicopter. "Mother, mother, look
at that helicopter!" But mother pulled
me away.
