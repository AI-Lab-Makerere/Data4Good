One morning my mother called me
and said, "Etabo, today you turn six
years old. We have a present for you."
"What is it? What is it?" I asked eagerly.
"Tomorrow we're going by bus to the
market in Eldoret," she replied, "And
we're taking you with us!" My first visit
to the city! I was so excited that I could
hardly sleep that night.
