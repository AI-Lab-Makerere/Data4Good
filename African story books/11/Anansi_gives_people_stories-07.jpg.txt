So Anansi went back down to earth to
get the second creature. He thought
and he thought and he came up with a
plan. He took a gourd full of water and
went to the tree where the hornets
lived. He poured out some of the water
all over their nest. Then he cut a leaf
from a banana tree and held it over
his head, and he poured the rest of the
water all over himself.
