One day the children put the baby under a
tree in the shade on a bright red blanket.
They went to play. The baby began crying as
usual. A group of cranes flew above the
playground and felt sorry for the crying baby.
They tried to get the children to notice that
the baby was crying but the children kept on
playing. The cranes decided to take the baby
and raise it themselves.
