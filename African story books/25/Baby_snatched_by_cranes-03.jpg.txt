The older children loved playing outside
during the day and they forgot about doing
their household chores. They called their
friends to come and play with them. The boys
loved playing soccer. The girls loved playing
with dolls around the yard. They forgot about
looking after the baby when their friends
arrived. The baby cried and cried and nobody
heard.
