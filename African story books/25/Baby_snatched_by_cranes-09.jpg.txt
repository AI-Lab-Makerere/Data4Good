The baby's family was sitting in the evening
feeling very sad. Suddenly, a big frog jumped
through the door. The frog told them about
how it swallowed their baby. They begged the
frog to give them the baby. "Give me three
flies to eat then I will give you the baby," said
the frog." The father caught three flies and
fed them to the frog. The frog coughed and
the baby popped out. The family and the frog
jumped and danced with joy."
