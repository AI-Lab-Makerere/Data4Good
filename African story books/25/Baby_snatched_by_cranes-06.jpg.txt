It was so hot that the mother decided to rest
under a tree. While she was resting she
heard her baby crying. She looked around
and she could not see anything. Then she
looked up and she saw four cranes flying
away with her baby in the bright red blanket.
She screamed and chased after the cranes.
When the woman told her husband what she
saw he did not believe her.
