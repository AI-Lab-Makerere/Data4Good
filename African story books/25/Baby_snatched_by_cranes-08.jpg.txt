A big frog heard the baby's cry. It came
closer and saw the baby wrapped in the
blanket. The frog thought the cranes had
stolen the baby, and decided to hide the baby
from the cranes. Suddenly the frog heard the
voices of the cranes. There was no time to
hide. The frog swallowed the baby and hid
behind a big rock. When the cranes arrived
they could not find the baby and they flew off
to look for it. The frog hopped back to the
baby's family home.
