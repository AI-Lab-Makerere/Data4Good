Nyame had to admit that Anansi had
paid his price. So he went to his
wooden box, opened the lid, and gave
all the stories to Anansi. Anansi carried
the stories triumphantly down to
earth. He shared them with his wife,
and with all the other animals and
people. Stories are for telling, not for
keeping in wooden boxes.
